/**
 * Tile styles. Everything here comes from ArcGIS Online and needs no API key.
 *
 * Two sources were tried and dropped, which is worth recording so they do not
 * come back. CARTO serves a real map but stamps "API KEY REQUIRED" across it --
 * light_all and dark_all included. That one is a warning about testing: the
 * watermarked tiles still differ from each other, so comparing bytes says
 * "fine". Only looking at the image finds it. `dev/probe-tiles.mjs` therefore
 * catches blank and blocked tiles, not watermarks; a new source needs one look
 * with human eyes.
 *
 * Home Assistant's own map card uses CARTO, so it currently shows that watermark
 * too -- copying "whatever Home Assistant uses" would inherit the problem. The
 * default is therefore Esri, which follows the theme and works worldwide.
 *
 * OpenStreetMap needed a second look: it is not the deprecated `{s}` subdomains
 * that get blocked, it is the missing referrer. See `TileSpec.referrerPolicy`.
 *
 * A style is a list of layers drawn in order: a base map, optionally overlays
 * with labels. `maxNativeZoom` is per layer because they run out at different
 * levels; Leaflet then upscales instead of showing nothing.
