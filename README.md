A Home Assistant integration that works out where each person actually is — and
a map card, shipped with it, that shows the day as a readable list of stays
instead of raw coordinates.

**One install, nothing to register.** The integration serves the card and keeps
its Lovelace resource up to date by itself, including after an upgrade.

## What it does

**Picks the tracker worth believing.** A person usually carries several — the
companion app, iCloud, a router that sees the phone on WLAN, a beacon — and they
disagree constantly. Averaging them puts the person where nobody is; taking the
newest makes them teleport. Each report is judged instead: a fix reported as
accurate to 0 m is refused (several trackers mean "no fix" by that), so is one
worse than your threshold, and so is one older than what we already have. A
tracker that sees a zone boundary crossed wins regardless of its accuracy;
otherwise the one being followed keeps the lead until another is measurably
better. The reason is on the sensor, so a tracker that never wins can be found.

**Says where that is.** Outside a zone the position is reverse geocoded through
Nominatim — once for the whole household, cached on disk across restarts, and
queued to one request per second. Inside a zone you get the name you gave it,
because "School" says more than the road it sits on.

**Presence that is not a yes/no.** `home` and `away` are useless in the two
minutes that matter, so arriving and leaving get their own states for a few
minutes: `just_arrived` and `just_left`.

**Distance and direction from home**, so an automation can act before somebody
pulls into the driveway.

**The map card**: everyone at once in their own colour, a range menu from the
current day down to a single hour plus a calendar for an exact window, street
and satellite tiles, zones as circles with their own icon, and the stay list
underneath. It opens on today.

## Install

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=Snaker-L&repository=ha-family-tracking&category=integration)

The button adds this repository to HACS on your own instance; then click
**Download** and restart Home Assistant. By hand: HACS → ⋮ → *Custom
repositories* → URL `https://github.com/Snaker-L/ha-family-tracking`,
category **Integration**.

Then Settings → Devices & services → **Add integration** → *Family Tracking*.
Leaving the people empty follows everyone, so somebody added later is included
by themselves.

Add the card to a dashboard from the card picker — it is already there, no
resource needed.

### Coming from 0.3.0 or earlier

Those versions were a dashboard card. Remove it in HACS, delete the
`/local/family-tracking-card.js` resource under Settings → Dashboards → ⋮ →
Resources, then install this. **Leaving the old resource in place breaks the
card**: the element would be defined twice. Your card configuration is
unaffected.

## Entities

Per person, one device with:

| Entity | State | Notable attributes |
|---|---|---|
| `sensor.<name>_location` | zone name, the enclosing place, or the address | `presence`, `source`, `latitude`, `longitude`, `gps_accuracy`, `distance_from_home`, `direction`, `bearing`, `street`, `city`, `postcode`, `country`, `last_decision`, `last_rejected` |
| `sensor.<name>_distance_from_home` | kilometres | `direction`, `bearing` |

`direction` is how the person is moving relative to home (`towards home`,
`away from home`, `stationary`); `bearing` is where they are from it (`N`, `SE`,
…). Two different questions, so two attributes.

`last_decision` says why the current fix was accepted (`first-fix`,
`zone-change`, `same-source`, `more-accurate`) and `last_rejected` why the most
recent report was not (`accuracy-zero`, `accuracy-poor`, `stale`,
`less-accurate`).

## Integration options

Set at install and changeable afterwards under *Configure*:

| Option | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| People to follow | everyone | Which `person` entities to watch |
| Resolve addresses | on | Reverse geocode positions outside a zone |
| Contact address | – | Passed to Nominatim, as their usage policy asks |
| Ignore fixes worse than | 100 m | Above this a fix says more about the radio than the person |
| Home zone | `zone.home` | Used for distance and direction |
| Address language | your HA language | Two-letter code |

## Card options

| Option | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `title` | string | – | Card header |
| `time_ranges` | list | `[1, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24]` | Entries of the range menu, in hours. *Today* heads the menu and the calendar sits beside it; neither can be configured away |
| `map_height` | number \\| `fill` | `480` | Height in pixels, or fill the space the card is given |
| `street_style` / `satellite_style` | see below | `esri_gray` / `esri_imagery` | Tiles |
| `custom_street` / `custom_satellite` | map | – | Own tile URL, when the style is `custom` |
| `person_colors` | map | palette | Colour per entity id |
| `hidden_persons` | list | `[]` | People the card leaves out entirely |
| `show_stays` | boolean | `true` | Stay list below the map |
| `show_zones` | boolean | `false` | Draw zones as circles with their icon |
| `zone_icons` / `zone_colors` | map | – | Icon and colour per zone |
| `hidden_zones` | list | `[]` | Zones the card leaves out |
| `geocode` | boolean | `true` | Resolve addresses for stays |
| `places` | boolean | `true` | Show the name of the place a stay is in, where it has one, instead of its address |

`hidden_persons` and `hidden_zones` store what is *excluded*, so anything added
later shows up instead of going missing.

Tile styles — `street_style`: `osm`, `esri_gray` (follows your theme),
`esri_streets`, `esri_topo`, `esri_relief`, `osm_hot`, `opentopo`,
`basemap_at`, `basemap_at_gray`, `custom`. `satellite_style`:
`esri_imagery`, `esri_hybrid`, `basemap_at_ortho`,
`basemap_at_ortho_labels`, `custom`. The `basemap_at` ones cover Austria only.

## Good to know

- **The recorder keeps 10 days by default**, so longer ranges come up empty.
  Raise `purge_keep_days` if you need more.
- **A stay inside a zone is exact** — arrival and departure come from the state
  changes. Only the parts outside any zone are clustered.
- **The card opens on today, not on the last 24 hours.** Asked where everyone
  has been, a rolling window answers with half of yesterday; midnight is the
  boundary people mean. *Today* heads the range menu, so it is one pick away
  again.
- **The map re-frames only when you change who is on it.** A new time range,
  incoming positions and switching to satellite leave your view alone.
- **A place is named, not addressed.** Reverse geocoding answers "what is
  nearest", which in the Donauzentrum is a phone shop and in the Q19 a coffee
  bar — and the street outside is no better, because nobody arranges to meet at
  Wagramer Straße 94. So the integration also asks Overpass what the fix falls
  *inside*: a shopping centre, a hospital, a university, a station. Where two
  answer at once — the centre and the unit within it — the larger one wins.
  Administrative areas never count; every fix is inside a district and a city,
  and neither says where somebody is.
- **A stay is the middle of many samples, and indoors they scatter.** Forty
  metres out is ordinary and puts the point outside the building, so the
  integration also looks a short way around it — but only for the kind of place
  that contains others. A café fifty metres away is somewhere else; a shopping
  centre fifty metres away is the building you are standing in.
- **Two services, one lookup.** Nominatim allows one request per second and
  asks for caching; Overpass is donated capacity. The integration keeps to
  both, asks them at the same time rather than one after the other, and caches
  the result for the whole household. Where Overpass cannot be reached the
  address is still shown — but it is not cached, so the centre is named as soon
  as the service answers again.
- **Both speak your language.** English and German are translated; anything else
  falls back to English. A language is one table in
  [`src/localize.ts`](src/localize.ts) and one file under
  [`custom_components/family_tracking/translations/`](custom_components/family_tracking/translations/).
- **Person pictures** come from the person entity; without one you get initials.
- **The integration brings its own icon.** Home Assistant 2026.3 and newer read
  it from `custom_components/family_tracking/brand/`; older versions show a
  placeholder instead.
