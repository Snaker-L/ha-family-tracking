One place that watches every tracker and keeps one answer per person.

Home Assistant's own `person` entity already picks a device tracker, but it only
tells you the zone. What is missing is everything around it: which tracker the
answer came from, how far away that is, whether the person is heading home, and
what the position is actually called. That is what this keeps.
