"""
Shipping the card with the integration.

The point of putting both in one repository is that nobody has to add a Lovelace
resource by hand, or remember to update it after an upgrade. So the integration
registers that resource itself.

Registering it as a resource rather than as an extra frontend module is not a
detail. An extra module is imported from the page head, before the frontend has
installed the custom element registry it later looks cards up in -- the card
then registers into a registry nobody reads, and the dashboard says the element
does not exist while the file loaded perfectly. Resources go through the
frontend's own loader, after that registry is in place. HACS registers every
card it manages the same way.
