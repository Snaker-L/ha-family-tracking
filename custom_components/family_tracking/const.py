CONF_GEOCODE: Final = "geocode"

# --- defaults ---------------------------------------------------------------

#: A fix reported as worse than this many metres says more about the radio
#: conditions than about where somebody is, so it is not allowed to move them.
DEFAULT_MAX_ACCURACY: Final = 100

#: Zero accuracy is not a perfect fix. Several trackers report it when they have
#: no fix at all, which is the opposite of what the number says.
ZERO_ACCURACY_IS_UNKNOWN: Final = True

DEFAULT_HOME_ZONE: Final = "zone.home"

#: How long a person stays marked as just arrived or just left. Long enough to
#: drive an automation from it, short enough not to lie about the present.
TRANSITION_SECONDS: Final = 180

# --- presence ---------------------------------------------------------------

# --- reverse geocoding ------------------------------------------------------

NOMINATIM_URL: Final = "https://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/reverse"

#: Their usage policy allows one request per second. Staying a little under it
#: costs nothing and keeps the card working for everybody else too.
MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL: Final = 1.1

#: Coordinates are rounded to this many decimals before they become a cache
#: key. Four is about eleven metres -- fine enough to tell two addresses apart,
#: coarse enough that standing still does not produce a new lookup every minute.
CACHE_PRECISION: Final = 4

CACHE_TTL_DAYS: Final = 90
STORAGE_KEY: Final = f"{DOMAIN}.geocode_cache"
STORAGE_VERSION: Final = 1

#: Bumped whenever a stored label would come out differently today. Entries
#: written under an older schema are dropped on load rather than migrated:
#: they are a convenience, and keeping them would hide the very change that
#: raised the number -- a shopping centre visited last week would go on
#: reading as the street outside it.
CACHE_SCHEMA: Final = 3

# --- enclosing places -------------------------------------------------------

#: One instance, deliberately.
#:
#: Mirrors looked like the answer to the 429s and 504s the main instance hands
#: out when busy, until one of them turned out to carry a single country: it
#: answers "200, nothing found" for everywhere else, which is indistinguishable
#: from "nothing encloses this fix" and would be cached as fact. A regional
#: mirror is worse than no mirror.
OVERPASS_URL: Final = "https://overpass-api.de/api/interpreter"

#: Overpass is donated capacity, and containment queries are cheap only for the
#: person asking. One every two seconds, on top of a cache that holds for
#: months, keeps this well inside what the service asks of a client.
VENUE_MIN_REQUEST_INTERVAL: Final = 2.0

#: Containment queries are answered in about a second, but the public instance
#: sometimes queues them. Waiting is free -- the label appears when it appears,
#: and nothing in the card is blocked on it.
VENUE_TIMEOUT: Final = 30

#: Answers that mean "busy, not wrong". Worth one more ask; anything else is a
#: real no.
VENUE_RETRY_STATUS: Final = frozenset({429, 502, 503, 504})

#: How long to leave Overpass alone after it says it is busy.
#:
#: Learned the hard way: a burst of queries against the public instance earns a
#: 429, and carrying on regardless earns a block that outlasts the session. A
#: dashboard opening with a dozen unresolved stays is exactly such a burst, so
#: the first refusal stops the rest of them. Nothing is lost -- the address is
#: shown meanwhile, and the names fill in on the next look.
VENUE_BACKOFF: Final = 600
